6954367	substitution	the conservative substitution	leads	arrest	an arrest	We found that the conservative substitution of Cnx1E residue Asp274 by Glu ( D274E ) leads to an arrest of MPT - AMP hydrolysis and hence to the accumulation of MPT - AMP .
6954367	.		cause	.		We reasoned that this is caused by the inability of a glutamate in position 274 to coordinate the octahedral Mg2 + - water complex in the Cnx1E active site .
